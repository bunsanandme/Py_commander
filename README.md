Py_commander
==========
File manager, literally an analog of Total Commander. Allows you to scroll through the directories of two disks, add, delete, copy, move folders.

Installation
-----
In cmd
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

What's next?
-------
In the future, I will still sort out the file extensions and add the launch. It is possible to add an internal editor for .txt files
Good luck!
